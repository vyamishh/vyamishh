**About Me**

Hello! I'm a passionate game developer and a BCA student with a keen interest in creating engaging and innovative games. I enjoy exploring different aspects of game development, from design and programming to storytelling and UI/UX design. Currently, I'm expanding my knowledge in C# and Unity, and I'm excited to bring my ideas to life.

**Projects**
1. Roll-a-Ball
   
My first project, a simple yet fun game where players control a ball to collect items while navigating through obstacles. This project helped me understand the basics of game mechanics and UI integration.

Technologies Used: Unity, C#

Features: Simple controls, Score tracking, game over screen

Status: Completed

2. Flappy Bird
   
A clone of the classic Flappy Bird game, which helped me delve deeper into 2D game mechanics and physics in Unity. This project was a great learning experience in terms of understanding player controls and obstacle generation.

Technologies Used: Unity, C#

Features: Simple controls, procedurally generated obstacles, UI elements like score tracking, game over and play again screens

Status: Completed
